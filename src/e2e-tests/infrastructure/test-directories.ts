/**
 * Test Workspace and Directory Management
 *
 * This module manages the creation and cleanup of isolated test directories used
 * during E2E testing. Each test gets an isolated workspace to prevent test
 * interference and allow parallel execution.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Create temporary test directories (workspace, extensions, user data, pack cache)
 * - Copy source workspaces to isolated test locations
 * - Clean up test directories after test completion
 * - Handle graceful cleanup of .vscode directories (ignore ENOENT errors)
